Printed Items:
- Motor Mount can be printed once for each side, does not need to be mirrored. Use a material with low amount of flex like PLA. Be generous with your walls and infill.
- Rear Y Belt holder contains both a base and a slide. Mirror for the other side. Will use a nut and bolt as tensioner.
- Front Y Belt Holder contains a base, slide, and endstop slide. Mirror for the other side. Will need an M3 heat set insert for the endstop slide.

Future Updates:
- Additional endstop holes for different switch sizes
- Adjust belt slides to accept more of the belt before cinching
- Diagram of critical measurements to make this work with your Lowrider V3

Updates will follow, just wanted to get this posted in the meantime for any and all who are interested. Reach out with questions!
